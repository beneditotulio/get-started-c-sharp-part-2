# Guided project - Develop foreach and if-elseif-else structures to process array data in C#


Gain experience developing a console app that implements arrays, foreach loops, and if statements to achieve app specifications.

# Learning objectives
In this module, you'll practice how to:

* Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses foreach loops to access array data.
* Use if statements to evaluate conditions and create code branches.

# Prerequisites
* Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes.
* Experience using if statements in C# to evaluate an expression and branch code accordingly.
* Experience using a foreach loop to access elements of array variables.


# Summary
Your goal was to build an application that uses a combination of iteration and selection statements to process the contents of arrays and achieve the design goals of your application.

By creating a nested combination of foreach and if statements, you built an application that processes the contents of student name and assignment score arrays to calculate and report student grades. The application logic supports adding additional students and assignment scores with minimal code updates.

Having the ability to implement nested iteration statements that process array data, and selection statements that branch the code execution path, enables you to create more efficient and extensible code.
