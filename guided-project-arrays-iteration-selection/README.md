# Guided project - Develop foreach and if-elseif-else structures to process array data in C#


Gain experience developing a console app that implements arrays, foreach loops, and if statements to achieve app specifications.

# Learning objectives
In this module, you'll practice how to:

* Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses foreach loops to access array data.
* Use if statements to evaluate conditions and create code branches.

# Prerequisites
* Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes.
* Experience using if statements in C# to evaluate an expression and branch code accordingly.
* Experience using a foreach loop to access elements of array variables.
