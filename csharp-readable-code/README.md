Write code that is easier to read, update and support using naming conventions, comments and whitespace.

##Learning objectives
In this module, you will:

* Choose descriptive names for variables that describe their purpose and intent.
* Use code comments to temporarily instruct the compiler to ignore lines of code.
* Use code comments to describe higher-level requirements or purpose for a passage of code.
* Write code that effectively uses whitespace to convey the relationship of lines of code.

##Prerequisites
* Experience declaring variables using common data types.
* Experience using Console.WriteLine() to output messages to a console.
* Experience using the if and else if statement.
